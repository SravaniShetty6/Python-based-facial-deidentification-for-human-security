# PYTHON-BASED-FACIAL-DE-IDENTIFICATION-FOR-HUMAN-SECURITY

This study explores the impact of **facial de-identification** on human pose estimation, a key task in computer vision. Facial de-identification involves two steps: detecting and tracking faces in images, followed by using techniques like **Gaussian blur** to obscure facial details for privacy protection. This process ensures that faces are not recognizable while preserving the rest of the image for analysis.

The research examines how this de-identification affects human pose estimation, particularly for **kinematic analysis** in fields like **occupational safety** and **clinical gait analysis**, where privacy is critical. The results show that the effect of facial de-identification on pose estimation is minimal and within acceptable limits. Thus, face blurring ensures subject privacy without degrading the accuracy of machine learning models used for human pose estimation.
